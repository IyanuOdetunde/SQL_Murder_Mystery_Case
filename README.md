# SQL_Murder_Mystery_Case
This project contains the step-by-step process of solving a murder mystery case in SQL City.

**A Crime Has Taken Place**
Welcome to the SQL Murder Mystery Case! In this interactive challenge, I stepped into the shoes of a detective and used my SQL querying skills to solve a murder mystery. A crime had taken place, and the detective needed my help to crack the case. My task began with retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database.

**Objective**
The mission was to uncover the details of the crime that occurred on January 15, 2018, in the city of SQL. The crime was a murder, and I was required to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report to kickstart my investigation. I used querying skills to extract the required information and examined the report closely.

**Findings**
In this engaging challenge, I took a hands-on approach to solve the mystery. My journey involved:
**Querying Skills:** I leveraged my SQL querying skills to extract crucial information from the police department's database. By crafting precise queries, I navigated through the data to access the crime scene report.

**Evidence Examination:** With the retrieved crime scene report in hand, i delved into the details provided, carefully analyzing the report, paying close attention to any evidence, clues, or important information it contained.

**Investigation Strategy:** I formulated a strategy for my investigation, deciding which pieces of information to focus on first. I wrote additional queries to gather more data, cross-reference facts, and to create a comprehensive picture of the events leading up to the murder.

**Insights and Conclusions:** Through diligent querying and analysis, I gained valuable insights into the case, constructed a timeline of events, identified potential suspects, and pieced together motives for the crime.

**Documentation:** My meticulous approach and findings have been thoroughly documented in the corresponding SQL file. This document captures queries, insights derived, and the logical progression of my investigation.
