--These results from the 2nd witness also match the results from the 1st witness.

-- Step 5:Based on the person id obtained from the two suspects, the interview table was queried to find out if there were any transcripts available
SELECT * 
FROM interview 
WHERE person_id IN (67318, 28819);
-- Only result displayed was for person_id 67318 (Jeremy Bowers), this also matches one of the car details obtained from 1st Witness with License ID 423327 driving a Chevrolet.

from person
INNER JOIN drivers_license
on person.license_id = drivers_license.id
